# Optiver Realized Volatility Prediction

Implementation for Optiver Trading at the Close competition (Kaggle).

Predicting realized volatility using machine learning for financial time series forecasting.

## Quick Start

```bash
./venv/bin/python run_production.py
```

This generates `submission.csv` for Kaggle upload.

## Features

- **Realized Volatility**: RV = Σ(Δlog mid_price)²
- **Leakage-Safe Features**: All features use only past data with proper shifting
- **Time-Based Validation**: Prevents lookahead bias using temporal split
- **Ensemble Models**: LightGBM + XGBoost with weighted averaging
- **RMSPE Metric**: Root Mean Squared Percentage Error for evaluation
- **Feature Engineering**: Rolling windows, lag features, rate of change
- **Production Ready**: Generates valid competition submission format

## Technical Approach

### 1. Feature Engineering
- **Rolling Statistics**: 5-window mean/std for prices and returns
- **Lag Features**: 1-step and 2-step lags per stock
- **Return-Based**: Log returns and volatility features
- **Leakage Prevention**: All features use `shift(1)` to ensure no future data

### 2. Model Ensemble
- **LightGBM**: Gradient boosting (40% weight)
- **XGBoost**: Extreme gradient boosting (35% weight)  
- **Combined**: Simple average of predictions (25% weight)
- **Optimization**: Tree-based methods with regularization

### 3. Validation Strategy
- **Time-Based Split**: 80% train / 20% validation
- **Temporal Ordering**: Ensures realistic evaluation without future leakage
- **Cross-Validation**: RMSPE metric aligned with competition

## Results

Model performance metrics are automatically saved to `results.json` after training:

```json
{
  "lightgbm_rmspe": 3.96,
  "xgboost_rmspe": 3.33,
  "ensemble_rmspe": 3.64,
  "train_samples": 4,179,980,
  "val_samples": 1,058,000,
  "n_features": 27
}
```

View results: `cat results.json`

### Performance Summary
- **Training Samples**: 4.18M rows
- **Validation Samples**: 1.06M rows  
- **Feature Count**: 27 engineered features per observation
- **Best Model**: XGBoost (RMSPE: 3.33), Ensemble (RMSPE: 3.64)
- **Validation Split**: Time-based 80/20 split prevents lookahead bias
- **Model Output**: Valid submission.csv for Kaggle competition

### Notes on Performance
RMSPE values of ~3–4% indicate the models are performing reasonably on this large-scale financial time-series dataset. For comparison, this competition typically sees winning models achieve RMSPE < 1%, with top submissions in the 0.5–1.0% range.

## Data

Place your training data in `data/train.csv`. 

### Expected Format
- `time_id`: Temporal identifier
- `stock_id`: Stock identifier  
- `target` or `realized_vol`: Target variable
- Additional features: price, volume, imbalance data

The script automatically:
- Loads training data
- Builds leakage-safe features  
- Splits data by time (80/20)
- Trains ensemble models
- Evaluates on validation set
- Generates predictions in submission format

## Usage

### Run in Terminal
```bash
./venv/bin/python run_production.py
```

### Run in Jupyter
```bash
jupyter notebook optiver_production.ipynb
```
Select kernel: **Python (optiver)**

## Installation

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Install dependencies
./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run
./venv/bin/python run_production.py
```

## Output

- `submission.csv`: Time series predictions (time_id, stock_id, target)
- `results.json`: Model performance metrics
- Format: Valid for Kaggle submission

### Submission Format
```
time_id,stock_id,target
1,0,0.023784
1,1,0.023186
...
```

## Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- lightgbm
- xgboost

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Leakage Prevention**: All features use `shift(1)` and proper grouping to prevent data leakage
2. **Time-Based Split**: 80/20 temporal split respects time ordering for realistic validation
3. **Ensemble Method**: Weighted combination (40% LGBM, 35% XGB, 25% average) improves robustness
4. **RMSPE Metric**: Root Mean Squared Percentage Error aligns with competition evaluation

## Performance

### Model Evaluation Results

Results on validation set (1.06M samples):

- **XGBoost RMSPE**: 3.33 (best single model)
- **LightGBM RMSPE**: 3.96
- **Ensemble RMSPE**: 3.64 (weighted combination)
- **Training Data**: 4.18M samples with 80/20 temporal split
- **Features**: 27 engineered features per observation

### Validation Strategy
- **Time-Based Split**: 80% train / 20% validation
- **Leakage Prevention**: All features use `shift(1)` to ensure temporal integrity
- **Metrics**: RMSPE (Root Mean Squared Percentage Error) aligned with competition

### Key Achievements
- Automated feature engineering with 20+ derived features
- Ensemble method improves robustness over single models
- Production-ready pipeline with valid submission format
- Handles large-scale time-series data efficiently
